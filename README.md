## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since this was an HTML and CSS challenge, I thought it would be a good opportunity to try out Tailwind CSS for the first time. There was a learning curve with the syntax, but it was pretty intuitive and easy to pick up. I think the base functionality is very useful for projects like this one. I would be open to using Tailwind for future projects, hopefully building on my knowledge to customize the base functionality a bit more. 


### Continued development

V2 of this challenge will include: 
- My personal links and profile
- Light and dark mode 
- HTML structured more for website accessibility   


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Since this was my first time using Tailwind CSS, these docs (v3.4) were my main resource while building out this project and I found them to be very helpful.
